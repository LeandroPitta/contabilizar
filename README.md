# Contabilizar

## Project Description

The project is built using Angular for the frontend. The application follows a component-based architecture, ensuring separation of concerns and scalability. The frontend is compiled and prepared for deployment on Firebase Hosting.

## Frontend

The frontend is developed using Angular, which provides a robust and scalable framework for building web applications. It leverages Angular Material for UI components and PrimeNG for advanced data table functionalities. The frontend is responsible for handling user interactions, displaying data, and communicating with the backend API.

### Key components:

- **Components**: Represent different parts of the UI and handle user interactions.
- **Services**: Contain business logic and interact with the backend API.
- **Modules**: Group related components and services together.

## Backend API

The application communicates with a backend API to fetch and update data. The backend API is assumed to be hosted separately and provides endpoints for managing data related to the application.
